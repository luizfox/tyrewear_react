Hi!
My name is Luiz Gomes, and here you can check out a small portfolio of an application I'm used to writing. I'm showing some Data Science and JavaScript skills.

Technically, I'm using R to create a linear regression (a technique where you predict a number), exposing it with a web service, and then using a ReactJS application to use this web service.

In addition to technology, I enjoy motorsport and motorsport simulation on PC. A key factor in motorsport is tyre saving. The problem I'm solving here is to predict how much a tyre will be worn out, giving the temperature of the track, the temperature	of the ambient and how much time racing, given a specific track	(Spa Francorchamps, in this case), a specific car (Porsche 919,	in this case. A three-times LeMans 24h champion) and no other car setup changes. You can see on the plot besides that the when the track is colder the tyre's wear is a way lesser.

This is useful to plan your race strategy.
